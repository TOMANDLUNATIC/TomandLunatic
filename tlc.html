        <!-- About TLC -->
        <div class="tl-card">
            <h2>About TLC</h2>
            <p>
TLC (Tom and Lunatic Championship) is not just a tournament — it’s a show. TLC features multiple match types: TLC: Regular Match, TLC: #1 Contender, TLC: Title Battle, TLC: Champ’s Call Out, and TLC: Fight Club.
<br><br>
In TLC, 8 teams are listed using a First-Come, First-Serve method. The first stage consists of two rounds of battles (BO1) among the 8 teams, called Regular Matches. The losing teams return to the team list. The final two teams from the Regular Matches advance to the TLC: #1 Contender match (BO1).
<br><br>
The winner of the #1 Contender match will face the TL Champion in the TLC: Title Battle. The winner of this match becomes or remains the TL Champion.
<br><br>
After that, the TL Champion will call out one team from the TLC Team List for a BO1 match. This is a non-title match called TLC: Champ’s Call Out.
<br><br>
Alongside these matches, every TLC day features one BO1 gauntlet-style match called TLC: Fight Club. This match does not lead to titles but affects rankings. The stats are recorded the same as other TLC matches and it is purely for battle experience. It is a draft game with no bans.
<br><br>
In Fight Club, teams are placed in a list. The winning team stays in the ring, while the losing team moves to the end of the list. The list rotates continuously, and matches run non-stop.
<br><br>
Players compete in organized matches, enjoy live commentary, and track weekly rankings.

        <!-- TLC Rules -->
        <div class="tl-card">
            <h2>TLC Official Rules</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Server & Lag</strong><br>
All matches will be hosted on the Indian (Mumbai) server.<br>
Teams from other regions are welcome, but must manage their own ping/lag issues. TL is not responsible for connection problems.</p>

<p><strong>2. Match Setup</strong><br>
All matches will be played in a custom lobby with 10 bans (4 bans in lobby + 6 bans in-game). Teams must adapt to ping issues; no host advantage will be provided.<br>
(TLC: Fight Club matches will have no bans.)</p>

<p><strong>3. Punctuality</strong><br>
Punctuality is important. We will wait for teams to arrive. There is no fixed time limit, but a patience limit applies.</p>

<p><strong>4. Player Conduct</strong><br>
Players must maintain respect and avoid toxic or harmful language. Recall spam is allowed, but sportsmanship and respect are required.</p>

<p><strong>5. Team Names & Logos</strong><br>
Team names, logos, and profile pictures must not contain profanity or offensive content. (This does not apply to player names.)</p>

<p><strong>6. Team Changes</strong><br>
Teams may update their rosters daily. A maximum of 2 player substitutions is allowed per day. A player cannot play for more than one team on the same day.</p>

<p><strong>7. Pause Rules</strong><br>
Each team is allowed 1 pause per match. Pause requests must be made in the TLC WhatsApp group, not in-game.</p>

<p><strong>8. Draft Issues & Disqualification Disputes</strong><br>
Issues such as wrong draft, wrong pick, or time disqualification must be discussed by both team captains in the TLC WhatsApp group. Following the rules strictly is not considered unsportsmanlike.</p>

<p><strong>9. Commentary</strong><br>
Commentary will primarily be in Tamil, with occasional English.</p>

<p><strong>10. Rules & Penalties</strong><br>
Any rule violations or misconduct may result in temporary or permanent bans from the TLC.</p>

<p><strong>11. Rewards</strong><br>
TL provides ₹25 for each BO1 win and ₹100 for each BO3 win. Any additional gifts from sponsors or fans will also be distributed to players.</p>

<p><strong>12. Defending Champions</strong><br>
Champions must defend their title weekly or bi-weekly to retain their status.</p>
